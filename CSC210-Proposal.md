## Minder 
Like Tinder, but for music.

## Proposal

**App Name:** Minder.  

**Target Audience:** People who want to go see concerts in their area but want to find/meet people to go with.  

**Problem:** Often when someone moves, is travelling, or friends do not have similar music tastes, it is hard to find people to go to concerts. By creating a simple way to find people that want to go to the same shows we can alleviate a lot of the stress around going to a show alone.  

**Minimum Requirements:** By having a user system we will meet the minimum requirements of a CRUD webpage. We also hope to interface with a music database API which will use AJAX requests.  

**Uniqueness:** There are plenty of sites to find concerts, and they all have a user system, but we could not find a website that was meant to bring people together with similar music taste.  

## Features
1. User system (CRUD).
2. Geolocation based concert feed (Using SongKick API).
3. Geolocation based matching system.
4. Chat system.
